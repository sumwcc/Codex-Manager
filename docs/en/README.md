# Documentation Index

`docs/` is the official long-form documentation directory for CodexManager.

Its purpose is simple:
- Keep governance notes, release guides, and operating manuals inside the repository.
- Make it easy for new contributors to find the right document without relying on tribal knowledge.

## Scope
- Root `README.md` / `README.en.md`: project overview and quick start.
- Root `CHANGELOG.md`: version history and unreleased changes.
- `report/*`: operations, troubleshooting, compatibility notes, and FAQs.
- `release/*`: build, packaging, release, and artifact documentation.

## Start here
- For the latest release notes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- If you are not sure which document to open first, use the table below.

## Ecosystem Pairing

### OpenCowork

- Repository: [AIDotNet/OpenCowork](https://github.com/AIDotNet/OpenCowork)
- Recommended pairing: use OpenCowork for local file operations, multi-agent execution, workplace messaging, and desktop automation, while CodexManager handles Codex account management, usage tracking, platform keys, and the local gateway entry point.
- Best for: teams that want to separate the execution workspace and office integration from account-pool management and gateway access.
- A simple way to think about it: **OpenCowork executes in the real workspace, CodexManager manages accounts and gateway access.**

## Contribution rules

### Commit documentation when it
- remains useful for future contributors,
- affects development, testing, release, or troubleshooting,
- or serves as a long-term source of truth.

### Do not commit documentation when it is
- a temporary draft,
- personal working notes,
- a disposable intermediate file,
- or a local-only experiment record.

## Ignored patterns
- `docs/**/*.tmp.md`
- `docs/**/*.local.md`

Do not use those suffixes for formal documentation.

## Naming

```text
Long-lived documents: topic.md
One-off reports: yyyyMMddHHmmssfff_topic.md
```

## Maintenance notes
- Add important governance material under `docs/` instead of expanding the README indefinitely.
- Keep version history in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep architecture notes in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Keep collaboration rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Put unreleased change details in `CHANGELOG.md`; keep the README focused on navigation and summary.
